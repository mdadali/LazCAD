  {: This class defines a 2D vectorial font typeface.

     The typeface is made up of 256 instances of
     <See Class=TVectChar> (so no unicode may be used). The font
     may be stored and retrived from a font file.

     The easy way to define a font typeface is by using the
     <I=True Type Font> converter that create it from a TTF font.

     The chars are indexed by their <I=ASCII> value. If a char
     is not defined, it will not be drawed and an underline will
     be shown.

     The space and carriage returns are handled automatically,
     but you can change their shape.

     Any font used by the application is registered in the
     system with an <I=Index>, that is used to save and retrieve
     the font from the disk and associate the correct font to
     the texts.

     If you change the indexes among different drawings, you
     could load the wrong file. In this case you will notice that
     the text is drawed with a different font. If the index
     doesn't correspond to any font and no default font is
     defined an exception will be raised and the drawing will not
     be loaded.

     See <See Function=CADSysSetDefaultFont> and the other
     registration functions for details.
